 FASHION-MNIST 
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend Fashion-MNIST to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.

# Clothes-Classification
In this I have used Fashion MNIST Dataset to differentiate between different clothes images like snaekers,boots, T-shirt etc..just load a image from your side and it will show you what is that clothe.Tensorflow,keras are the deep learning dependencies that are used in this project
